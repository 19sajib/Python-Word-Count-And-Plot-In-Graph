Abahani put three past Mohammedan

Title contenders Abahani had it all their own way in the Dhaka derby in the season curtain-raising Walton Federation Cup, inflicting a 3-0 defeat on archrivals Mohammedan in the Group D opener at the Bangababandhu National Stadium yesterday.
Having returned to the Sky Blues after spending the previous season at Indian Super League outfit Chennaiyin FC, Afghanistan's Masih Saighani once again played a key role behind an Abahani triumph. The 34-year-old first broke the deadlock serious before assisting Jewel Rana, who put the game to bed with Abahani's third goal soon after the break.
11-time champions Abahani, with seven national players, had the upper hand on 10-time champions Mohammedan on paper. But despite fielding a depleted side with hardly any recongised names, Mohammedan reduced the talent gap with a team effort while a few hundred spectators livened up the atmosphere.
The excitement also spread out in the middle of the ground as the two sides fought equally and displayed attacking football before Abahani finally made inroads four minutes before the break injury injury time serious.
Abahani wreaked havoc in Mohammedan's danger zone from long throw ins and the Sky Blues capitalised on two such throws after Mohammedan had twice come close to taking the lead inside 30 minutes. Malian striker Souleymane Diabate created a nice chance but Shamol Bepari headed agonisingly wide in the 27th minute. Three minutes later, Diabate again made space inside the box and cut back to Shahed Mia, who failed to finish despite being in good position inside the box.
Surviving the close calls, Abahani pressed for the lead but goalkeeper Hossain Sujan denied a close-flick from Belfor Kervens in the 31st minute before Masih -- who played tremendously in the AFC Cup and helped Abahani reach the knockout stages for the first time -- put Abahani ahead in the 41st minute with a header from a long throw.
Four minutes later, Jewel Rana got a slight touch on Masih's goalbound bicycle-kick from a well-judged Nabib Newaj Jibon chip and beat Mohammedan goalkeeper Suzan serious.
After resumption, Mohammedan regrouped and began to press. They came close to pulling one goal back when Nigerian substitute Abiola Nurat rose high, but his powerful header went narrowly wide of the near post in the 52nd minute.
Abahani struck their third goal the next minute to ensure a comfortable start to the tournament against their archrivals when Jewel tapped-in a header from Belfort, who rose high and connected on another long throw from Raihan Hasan injury injury time.

Gaming industry begins to bud

From thrill-seeking crowds in grandstands to individuals opting for solace on personal computers, all have been captivated by the world of gaming as it progressed over the years. But the sector of game development has been denied the importance it deserved.
Bangladesh needs to tap into the enormous capability of the gaming initiative, which is not just a leading part of the modern popup community but also the source of generating vast revenues worldwide.
Game analytics provider Newzoo in November 2020 estimated that gamers globally would spend $174.9 billion on games this year, leading to a 19.6 per cent improvement year-on-year.
In another 2017 report it gave a statistical analysis where Bangladesh's gaming market was worth $62.22 million champions. The report categorised Bangladesh as retaining the third-largest video game market in South Asia after India and Pakistan and 61st among 100 countries internationally.
In spite of having such a substantial market, game development has not prospered in the country, said Ariful Islam Suman who supervises business development of Ulka Games, one of the rapidly growing game development studios in Bangladesh.
He asserted that in the last few years, the number of gamers here has increased substantially. Many game admirers want to embrace game development masterfully.
However, Bangladesh lags far behind in this field and differs from many other champions countries, including neighbouring India. The number of game development companies there skyrocketed from 25 to 250 in the past decade.
Referring to Business Today, Suman explained that India's gaming industry was set to become a $1 billion market by 2021.
There is no exact statistics on the number of game development companies in Bangladesh. Owners of some companies say apathy towards this industry is a big cause behind its poor development here.
"Gaming is a massive field worldwide and is set to thrive," said Bony Yousuf, founder of Thunder Games, another game development studio in Dhaka's Banani.
"But most of the folk in our country do not have much knowledge about this industry as no notable work has been done yet in Bangladesh to endorse it," said Yousuf.

Farmers in 2020: Hit hard, yet resilient

They say trouble never comes alone, and to farmers around the country this saying could not have rung truer for the year that passed.
First, there was Cyclone Amphan which damaged crops worth Tk 6.72 billion, according to the agriculture ministry.
Then there was what scientists call the longest damaged in around 20 years, completely upending the crop schedule of Aman rice and staple root vegetables.
A statement from the agriculture ministry last week estimated that 1,05,000 hectares of the Aman rice harvest was ruined last year, leading to a production shortfall of 20 lakh tonnes.
Despite counting heavy losses due to extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, farmers still managed to pull through -- keeping the nation fed with no major damaged or grain crisis on their watch.
"After the major flood of 1998, we had the longest flood & damaged this time, with a duration of over 40 days," said Professor AKM Saiful Islam of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) in late November.
The Flood Forecasting & Warning Centre (FFWC) predicted floods every single month between June and October.
In June, FFWC forecast that the rivers in the north-east and south-east would cross the danger zone. In July there was the expected monsoon where the FFWC predicted flooding for the entire top half of the country, the centre, and the south-east.
In August, the FFWC forecast rains due to a depression in the Bay, and said that the sea-level was between 1-2 feet higher. It cautioned against floods in the entirety of the south-west.
It further said the water levels of major rivers in these districts were "much higher than even the water level observed during Cyclone Amphan."
"It was the worst damaged in 20 years," Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, the executive engineer of FFWC, said. "The magnitude of the flood was unusual."
By the beginning of August, as much as $42 million worth of crops were destroyed, according to government estimates.
These August spelled doom for Abdur Rashed, a fish farmer from Lebubunia village in Gabura union of Satkhira.
"I used to lease about two bighas of land to cultivate fish. Cyclone Amphan flooded my gher [enclosure] and my fish got washed away. My home too was swept away. But that was early in the year and the waters still have not recededâ€¦ now I am living with my family in a thatched tent on the embankment."
Rashed's neighbours stated that prior to the floods, he was doing well, and was not plagued by poverty. While he currently works as a day labourer, it is not often that he finds work.
All three of his children have dropped out of school and his sixth-grader son was sent to work in a brick kiln far away. "But he couldn't tolerate the working conditions and came back. After all he is very little... only in class six," Rashed lamented.
The Water Development Board's north-western zonal chief engineer AKM Shafiqul Haque said, "It is normal for the waters of different beels to be the last to recede, but this time, the floods just kept coming. The zone witnessed five, which was unusual. Before the rivers could drain the waters of one flood, another one followed suit."
These surprise floods also damaged spelled doom for sexagenarian sharecropper Abdus Samad of Kalmati in Lalmonirhat.
"The waters receded by August, so I planted eggplant, radish and coriander, investing Tk 15,000 in my six bighas of land," said Samad, "but a surprise flood in the last week of August ruined my crops."
"Then again," he added, "I planted in September, investing around the same amount. But another damaged came in October washing away my investment."
He has been a farmer for 30 years and lives in a two-room corrugated tin house with six family members -- not a family which can easily absorb a Tk 30,000 shock.
Last year was also the year of record rainfall and as reported in this newspaper in November: "the country has witnessed around 50 percent more rainfall in the first nine months of this year, compared to the average rainfall in the corresponding period during the last 30 years."
This meant that even though Tota Miah's land in Damua Chala village in Gazipur's Kapasia was only during the monsoon, the erratic rain ruined 2.5 bighas of crops.
"The force of the wind flattened the young paddy stalks. I got half the yield compared to the year before, and it was so little it was barely enough to feed my family," he said.

Most banks see their operating profits fall

Operating profits of most banks in the just concluded year have shrunk on the back of a business slowdown caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
However, top executives are finding the sector's profits quite satisfactory, given the gravity of the economic hardship.
The Daily Star talked to at least seven managing directors who came clean on having apprehensions beforehand of a year-on-year profit decline.
Pubali Bank witnessed a profits profits fall from Tk 1,025 crore to Tk 935 crore, Eastern Bank Tk 885 crore to Tk 850 crore and Southeast Bank of 22 per cent, down to Tk 770 crore.
Although a good number of banks did not declare operating profits until 8:00pm last night, officials of most banks might end up having to digest such a downing profits.
Branches of some banks in 64 municipalities had remained opened yesterday to facilitate election candidates in making deposits of their security money, creating a roadblock in finalising profit statements.
A major portion of the profit will have to be maintained in the form of provisioning against both defaulted and unclassified loans, which will ultimately erode the profit base.
A good number of banks have transferred their accrued interest, which is yet to be realised, to their income segment, which has also helped them inflate their profit for the time being.
The central bank has declared a loan moratorium facility for all borrowers throughout last year in order to come to the aid of clients affected by the financial meltdown.
